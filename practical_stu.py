Arrays

Write a function that, given an array, creates another array called "squares" that holds the values of the original array, squared.
Then return the equivalent of the original array concatenated with squares. (Hint: you will need to create another array to do this!)

Lists

Write a function that, given a filename and a letter, prints out the elements that start with the given letter. You must use a list at some point in your function!
